# A personal portfolio 
A simple flask project deployed on EC2 instance.  
I used Jenkins to integrate with GitHub 
So that whenever I push commit the build is triggered 
And the new version of the application will be containerized and deployed on the EC2 instance.
I used docker for containerization.
